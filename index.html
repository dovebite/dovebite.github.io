		<h2>WELCOME TO MY NEST</h2>
		  <p>You have wandered into Dove's little corner of the world wide web!
		  I wanted to build this website as a hub for all the things that have to do with me as well as a collection of little things I see and like and want to share with the world.
		  We exist in cyberspace just as much as we do in the 'real world'. This is my way of carving out a little existence for myself.</p>
		  <p>I want to say I build this website as a way to consolidate my online presence a bit, but honestly, this still only consodilates a small part of it. I wanted to build this website as an exercise of HTML and CSS 
		  as well as an exercise is attemtpting to consolidate the many facets of who I am as a person and how I exist in cyberspace.</p>

				<h1>ABOUT THIS SITE</h1>
				<p>I miss the old internet, where a good number of websites were nothing more than a declaration of people's personalities, passions and obessions. That is what I want this website to be! This site can be summed up as:</p>
				<p>This is me</p>
				<p>These are my interests</p>
				<p>Here is what I have created</p>

          <p>
            I will now show you how to use the most common HTML text elements:
            <b>This is bold text.</b> 
            <strong>This is also bold text.</strong> 
            <i>This is italic text.</i> 
            <em>This is also italic text.</em> 
            <strike>This is strikethrough text.</strike> 
            <u>This is underlined text.</u> 
  
            <code>This is code (displayed in a monospace font).</code>
            <abbr title="Example.">This is an abbreviation (Try hovering over it).</abbr>
            <mark>This is highlighted text.</mark>
            This is a line break (The br stands for break.): <br />It's different from a paragraph because it does not add space inbetween the lines of text.
          </p>
          <p>This is a paragraph. As you can see, there's a bit of space between it and the previous paragraph.</p>

          <blockquote>This is a blockquote. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor.</blockquote>
